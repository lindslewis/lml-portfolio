# lml-portfolio

## description

This portfolio is a first go at creating my own portfolio via React. While it is currently still very basic, I am excited to continue to expand it and turn it into a fun space that represents myself and my work. In the  next few weeks, expect to see some growth in animation, theme, and overall layout!

## usage

This application is purely for the display of skills and prior projects for my own professional development. It is intended as a creative space for myself, to represent myself when I do not have the words to do so.

## composition

This application was built with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [emailjs-com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)
- [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

## growth

Expectations for upcoming changes to the applicaton:

- Stronger theme to set the tone throughout the depths of the application. 
- Animations to test and practice my own skills, providing further personality to the portfolio.
- A more interactive space, away from the typical "navigation bar, point A to point B" and into a more creative mind space, insisting upon user interaction.
- Better built out projects to make up my portfolio examples.
